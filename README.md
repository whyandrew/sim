Sensor failures


4 - Horizontal velocity sensor
  Can't land, need better calculation probably.
5 - Vertical velocity sensor
  Comes close to landing but won't lower itself down the last little bit.
6 - Horizontal position sensor
  Maybe this can be improved but it seems like a long shot to get it to
  find the landing pad without it.

8 - Angle sensor
7 - Vertical position sensor
  Usually seems to land fine.
9 - Sonar
  Laser_Rot_Scan needs a lot of work. With that disabled, can usually
  land on easy map and sometimes on hard.
